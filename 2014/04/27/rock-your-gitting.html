    <p>GIT. What a monster, uh? A tool developers use everyday. Unfortunately
we don’t always give it as much attention as it needs. Gitting as a
pro will give you tools enough to make your everyday work as a
developer easier.</p>

<p>I’d like to write a series of posts about git. Some tricks and some
good practices that I apply.</p>

<h2 id="i-know-nothing-about-git-where-to-start">I know nothing about git, where to start?</h2>

<p>If you are a complete newbie read
<a href="http://git-scm.com/book">the git book</a> and play with it.</p>

<h2 id="what-should-i-do-if-i-have-problems-with-git">What should I do if I have problems with git?</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Read the manuals. For a given command, you can read the manual with
<code class="highlighter-rouge">git help command</code>, e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">git help commit</code>.</li>
  <li>Read the books. If you want to get a good theoretical understanding
of git, this is the source,
<a href="http://git-scm.com/book">the git book</a>. It explains pretty much
everything about git.</li>
  <li>Google. If you are getting into a problem with git and nobody has
ever had it you are either doing it wrong or a super expert git
user (and there’s very little help you van find in this blog about
git).</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="git-config-and-basic-tools">git config and basic tools</h2>

<p>First step to get into a new level with git is to tune up your
config. This is pretty much a personal choice and you should take some
time to understand the config options you have and to test
them. <a href="https://github.com/franciscoj/dot-files/blob/master/git/gitconfig">These</a>
are my config choices in case you want to have something as a base.</p>

<p>Most of the things there are pretty much autoexplained, so I will just
go through the ones which are not.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[push]
  default = current
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This prevents you from pushing all your branches if you <code class="highlighter-rouge">git push</code>
with no other paremeters.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[core]
  excludesfile = /some/path/.gitignore
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[alias]
  l = log --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)an&gt;%Creset' --abbrev-commit --date=relative
  co = checkout
  s = status --short -b
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">git l</code> will pretty print the log. Pretty easy to have a global view
of how’s your repo going.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">git s</code> will show the short status. This means that you will have
something like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>## master...origin/master
 D Gemfile
AM _posts/2013-04-27-rock-your-gitting.markdown
?? file
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>instead of something like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

        new file:   _posts/2013-04-27-rock-your-gitting.markdown

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add/rm &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)

        deleted:    Gemfile
        modified:   _posts/2013-04-27-rock-your-gitting.markdown

Untracked files:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)

        file
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You still can see the full status with <code class="highlighter-rouge">git status</code> instead of <code class="highlighter-rouge">git s</code>.</p>

<p>This is a list of global ignores. Which means that they are applied to
all the files on all your git managed projects. Things like personal
OrgMode files, notes, todos, personal scripts, .ruby-version
files… anything you want to use and don’t want to share with your
coworkers but it is not in the project’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">.gitignore</code>.</p>

<p>There are dozens of other config options you can be interested
in. Have a look to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">git config</code> help.</p>

<p>Pretty much everybody uses github nowadays one way or another. I’ve
seen people struggling with getting the keys working many, many
times. Have a look
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys">here</a> on how to
do it since they explain it very well.</p>

<p>If you want a good command line tool to help a bit with git (kind of a
GUI in your terminal) have a look to
<a href="https://github.com/jonas/tig">tig</a> AFAIK it is included in Ubuntu
repos and mac’s homebrew as well so it is pretty easy to install.</p>

<p>There’re are some good helpers in the
<a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/git-extras">git-extras</a> repo. Special
mention for <code class="highlighter-rouge">git undo</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">git ignore</code> commands. Those are included
on Ubuntu and mac’s homebrew as well.</p>

<p>Give some love to your shell too. Try to find a way to show your
current git branch and your current git status on your branch. I use
<a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh">oh-my-zsh</a> with the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">sunrise</code> theme to get something like this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gd">--- src/blog ‹master* AMD?› »
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you use emacs, have a look to
<a href="http://magit.github.io/magit.html">magit</a>.</p>

<p>If you use Vim, have a look
to <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive">fugitive</a>.</p>

<p>If you use other IDE/editor please add your tool of choice to the
comments!</p>

<p>That’s pretty much everything to go from “I annoyingly work with git”
to “We do understand each other”.</p>
